# Safer Together

Safer Together is a new consortium for not-for-profit providers of services for victims of domestic abuse. The goal of the consortium is to safeguard and grow high quality service provision for victims of domestic abuse across Lancashire, through working with commissioners to co-design services, creating a single point of contracting, and by tendering competitively for public and private service contracts via a range of channels. Our philosophy is that we are stronger together than apart.

### What?

This app is a risk assessment survey targeted at victims of domestic abuse who have recently experienced a call-out from emergency services. The survey will take the user through a series of questions, modelled on the Risk Identification Checklist (RIC) for MARAC Agencies, and on completion provide them with useful resources, contact details for the relevant channels, and forward them and their survey results onto Safer Together for futher support if desired.
 
### Why?

As many as 1 in 4 women are affected by domestic violence in the UK. This app should empower victims by giving them insight into the risk of their current situation, and providing them the necessary resources and support channels to take action.

### How?

The initial prototype will focus on creating the survey and risk assessment page using Sass, Greensock and Slick.

Future iterations will focus on making the app downloadable from Safer Together's website and creating a database that stores the survey results and makes them accessible to Safer Together.
