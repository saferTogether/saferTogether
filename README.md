# Safer Together

## Team

The team consists of [@daymos](https://github.com/daymos), [@bradreeder](https://github.com/bradreeder), [@sofiapoh](https://github.com/sofiapoh) and [@shadows666](https://github.com/Shadows666), who are building a questionnaire to check the risk of a potential domestic abuse victim on behalf of Safer Together.

### Why?

Safer Together is a new consortium for not-for-profit providers of services for victims of domestic abuse. The goal of the consortium is to safeguard and grow high quality service provision for victims of domestic abuse across Lancashire, through working with commissioners to co-design services, creating a single point of contracting, and by tendering competitively for public and private service contracts via a range of channels. Our philosophy is that we are stronger together than apart.

### What?

A questionnaire to assess the risk of a potential domestic abuse victim.

### How?

The team will build a short questionnaire based on the police assessment questionnaire to check the risk of a potential domestic abuse victim using HTML, CSS(Sass) and Javascript.

#### Naming:
<i>Javascript:</i> camelCase
<br>
<i>CSS:</i> lower-case (with dashes)
